    If you are seeing this page, then your host application don't have any Shell Component
    configured and no other Micro-Frontend Application registered
  </p>
  <h2 id="shell-component">Shell Component</h2>
  <p>
    A Shell Component is a special Micro-Frontend application that provides a Web Component to be
    rendered and wrap the main rendering area for other Micro-Frontend Applications
  </p>
  <p>
    A Shell Component is optional. If no Shell Component is provided, the host application will use
    a blank Shell Component to render the Micro-Frontend Applications. In fact, if you are seeing
    this page, it means that the host application is using the blank Shell Component. When you
    register a MFE that matches the root path, this <i>About page</i> will be replaced by the MFE.
